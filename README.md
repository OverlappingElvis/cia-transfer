# About

Cross-platform front end for remotely installing CIA files using the [FBI title manager](https://github.com/Steveice10/FBI). Based on [Boop](https://github.com/miltoncandelero/Boop) and [servefiles.py](https://github.com/Steveice10/FBI/blob/2.4.5/servefiles/servefiles.py).

# Usage

## From binaries (experimental)

See releases for latest builds.

## From source

Clone this repository, `npm install`, and `npm start`

# Why do this?

I have a modded 3DS that I use *to play games that I legally own and have made personal backups of*. FBI is great, but there isn't a good remote install front-end that supports Mac, which I use the most.
